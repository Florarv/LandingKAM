                explanation: "The KAM's critical role is to be the 'voice of the customer' internally and to lead the alignment of the internal team. Presenting a fragmented message to the customer erodes trust, as highlighted in the Henkel case."

                explanation: "This approach, drawn from the workshop, demonstrates proactivity, empathy, and ownership. Waiting for perfect information destroys trust. A mass email is impersonal and alarming. Delegating abdicates the KAM's responsibility for the relationship."

This is the essence of value selling."
